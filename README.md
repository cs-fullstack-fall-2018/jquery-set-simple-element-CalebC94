# Exercise to select and modify elements using jQuery

Each of the <div><\div> elements wants to be assigned a color or have an event binded to it. 
  
Use jQuery to give them their desired features.

```
<body>
    <div class='red'>I should be red!</div>
    <div class='red'>I should be red too!</div>
    <div id="myElement">I should be blue! When you click on me, I want you to invoke a function that uses alert() to display the message "myElement was clicked!"
        <div>But I want to be green!</div>
        <div>But I want to be orange!</div>
    </div>
    <div class='red'>Red please!</div>
</body>
```
